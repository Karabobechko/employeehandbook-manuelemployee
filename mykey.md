# myKEY #

You will need a myKEY to enrol and to access Compensation Web Applications, access your pay stubs, encrypt documents on your desktop, send and receive encrypted email messages and securely connect to the Government of Canadaâ€™s Secure Remote Access. The myKEY program enhances the online security of communications and transactions by and between Government of Canada employees. 

## How to get a myKEY ##

If you do not have a myKEY, or if yours has expired or become inactive (which happens when you do not use it for several months), you can:
- use the [Online Registration and Credential Administration (ORCA)](https://eajl-orca.securise-secure.gc.ca/O/vw/bienvenue-welcome-eng.pub) system to manage your myKEY
